      I, who witnessed the murder of my multi-millionaire parents as a child, swore to avenge their
      deaths. I have trained extensively to achieve mental and physical perfection, mastering
      martial arts, detective skills, and criminal psychology. Costumed as a bat to prey on
      criminalsâ€™s fears, and utilizing a high-tech arsenal, I have become the legendary Batman.
